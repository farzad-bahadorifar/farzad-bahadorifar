<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Farzad Bahadorifar</h1>
## 💫 About Me:
I am a frontend developer based in Iran with around 1 year of experience working with Angular. Currently, I am developing my skills at a software company where I am involved in debugging frontend applications.<br>My main area of focus has been learning Angular, working on features and interfaces. While at this role, I am gaining exposure to backend development through exposure to technologies like .NET and C#.<br>Outside of work, I am continuously working to expand my Angular knowledge through hands-on projects and self-study. Currently, I am reading the book "A no-nonsense guide to building web applications with Angular" to improve my understanding of Angular fundamentals.<br>In the future, I aim to strengthen my software architecture skills and full stack abilities. I am interested in frameworks like NestJS and backend technologies like Node.js. Given my experience with C#, I also want to deepen my skills in .NET development.<br>My goal is to become a well-rounded developer with a solid grasp of design principles and patterns. I enjoy learning through practice and taking on new challenges. Please feel free to check out samples of my work on GitHub as I continue developing my skills.<br>Let me know if you have any other suggestions! I've aimed to provide an accurate portrayal of my current abilities and areas of focus without overstating my experience level.
