<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Farzad Bahadorifar</h1>


🔭 I’m currently working on debugging frontend applications at a software company.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Angular, JavaScript and .NET technologies.

🤝 I’m looking for help with improving my software architecture skills and full stack abilities.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about NestJS, Node.js and strengthening my .NET skills.

💬 Ask me about Angular, building web applications or my experience with C#.

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time I enjoy learning through hands-on projects and self-study.
